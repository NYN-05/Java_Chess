# Quick Guide: Using the Chess Timer ⏱️

## Starting a Timed Game

### Quick Start (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Launch the chess game
2. Click **Timer** menu
3. Select **10 minutes (no increment)**
4. Start playing - timer switches automatically!

### Popular Time Controls

**For Quick Games (5-10 minutes):**
- **Timer** → **5 minutes (no increment)** - Blitz chess
- **Timer** → **10 minutes (no increment)** - Quick game

**For Normal Games (15-20 minutes):**
- **Timer** → **15 minutes + 10 sec** - Balanced gameplay
- **Timer** → **Custom...** → 20 min, 5 sec increment

**For Long Games (30+ minutes):**
- **Timer** → **30 minutes (no increment)** - Classical chess
- **Timer** → **Custom...** → 60 min, 0 sec increment

## Understanding the Timer Display

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ ⚫ Black:  10:00 │  ← Black's remaining time
│ ⚪ White:   9:45 │  ← White's remaining time (🟢 when active)
└──────────────────┘
```

**Colors Mean:**
- 🟢 **Green** = This player's clock is running
- ⚪ **White/Gray** = Clock is paused (other player's turn)
- 🔴 **Red** = Time ran out! Game over!

## What is Increment?

**Increment** = Time added after each move

**Examples:**
- **15+10**: Start with 15 minutes, get +10 seconds per move
- **5+0**: Start with 5 minutes, no time added
- **10+5**: Start with 10 minutes, get +5 seconds per move

**Why use increment?**
- Prevents time scrambles
- Allows strategic thinking
- Balances speed and quality

## Playing with Timer

1. **Make your move** - Click or drag piece
2. **Timer switches automatically** - Your clock stops, opponent's starts
3. **Increment is added** - If using increment (e.g., +10 sec)
4. **Opponent's turn** - Their timer starts counting down

**Tips:**
- 💡 Move quickly in simple positions
- 💡 Use time wisely for complex positions
- 💡 Watch both timers!
- 💡 Increment gives you breathing room

## What Happens When Time Runs Out?

When a player's timer reaches **0:00**:
1. ⏱ Timer shows **0:00** in **RED**
2. 🚫 Game ends immediately
3. 🎉 Opponent wins by timeout
4. 📢 Message: "_[Color] ran out of time! [Winner] wins!_"

**Note:** Even if you're winning, if you run out of time, you lose!

## Setting Custom Time

Want a specific time control?

1. **Timer** → **Custom...**
2. Enter values:
   ```
   Minutes per side: [10]    ← Each player's starting time
   Increment (seconds): [5]  ← Time added per move
   ```
3. Click **OK**
4. Timer starts!

**Popular Custom Settings:**
- **1+1**: Bullet (super fast!)
- **3+2**: Fast blitz
- **10+5**: Quick but fair
- **20+0**: Longer blitz
- **45+15**: Serious game
